> Front-end project to my other project [web-shop](https://github.com/yonathan-uchoa/web-shop/)

### About the project

You can test this project in this [Vercel server](https://web-shop-react-beryl.vercel.app/).

It's a simple webpage, created with **vite template**, to connect with my back-end server [web-shop](https://github.com/yonathan-uchoa/web-shop/). In this project you can add items to the cart, remove then and send a simple checkout - without payments methods -, you can't add or update a product (this can be do in the back-end only).

As you can see, I'm training my React and TS with this project and his objective is to show **a simple full-stack project** with the back-end.
